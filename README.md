# Google-Results-Enhancer
### A Chrome extension to increase your productivity


This project is the result of a personal passion to increse productivity and re-imagine established practices.


## Why
- Google search results are returned as truncated text, wasting about half of your screen's precious real-estate
- There is NO native way to utilise this blank space, leading to extended scrolling when you really dont have to
- This extension resolves this by adding 3 things:
1. A 2-column view of the results
2. A auto-hiding information side-panel
3. Numbering of the results so you never loose track


## See it in action
This video shows the effect of the extension on the googlr results for the query "koi"

## Why not Publish on the Chrome Web Store?
Unfortunately, publishing to the Chrome Web Store isn't free; and eventhough the fee is Justifiable, it isn't Affordable.
